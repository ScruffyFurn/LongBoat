# Longboat Game Analytic Library
Game Analytics library for heat mapping using Microsoft's Azure platform for storage.

# What is a Heat Map?
A 'Heat Map' as seen to the right is A heat map is a graphical representation of data with a color-coding to put emphasis on areas of interest. This allows you to identify issues with your game. For example: The heat map is showing places where people in your game died and there are large concentrated patches of red/orange and alot of blue surrounding it. This could mean that there is an issue killing players in that place more often.

# Why Azure?
Azure blob storage offers a simple and elegant way to store large amounts of data. It is especially great when you want to save the data but dont care what particular order you get it back in when retrieving it. Using Block Blob storage is a great solutions for this since it ios quick and easy and doesnt meddle with sorting.
